// A pipeline is a series of stages connected by channels,
// where each stage is a group of goroutines running the same function.

// In each stage, the goroutines:
// 1- receive values from upstream via inbound channels
// 2- perform some function on that data, producing new values
// 3- send those values downstream via outbound channels

// first stage -> source or producer
// last stage -> sink or consumer

// generate is the first stage, it converts a list of integers into a channel which emits those numbers
func generate(numbers ...int) <-chan int {
	out := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for _, n := range numbers {
			out <- n
		}
		close(out)
	}()
	return out
}

// power is the second stage, it powers the numbers received from stage 1 and sends them to another channel
func power(in <-chan int) <-chan int {
	out := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for n := range in {
			out <- n * n
		}
		close(out)

		var total int
		for n := range in {
			total += n

}

// FAN-OUT
// Multiple functions can read from the same channel until that channel is closed.
// It provides a way to distribute work amongst a group of workers to parallelize CPU use and I/O.

// FAN-IN
// A function can read from multiple inputs and proceed until all are closed by multiplexing
// the input channels onto a single channel thatâ€™s closed when all the inputs are closed.
